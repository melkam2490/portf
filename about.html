            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
Here's an expanded version of your biography:

My name is Malika Worku, and I am originally from Ethiopia. I am currently pursuing an associate degree in Web Development at Seattle Central College, where I have developed a strong passion for creating responsive, user-friendly websites. My education has provided me with a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, and Django.

Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on numerous projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. From redesigning websites to building portfolio pages, I have gained hands-on experience in creating seamless and visually appealing web solutions. I pride myself on my attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and a deep commitment to ensuring that my work meets the highest standards.

As a web developer, I am particularly interested in responsive design and user experience. I enjoy the challenge of making websites look great and function perfectly on any device, from desktops to mobile phones. Additionally, my background in art and creativity has helped me bring a unique perspective to web design, allowing me to create aesthetically pleasing and highly functional web pages.

I am excited about the opportunities ahead and am eager to continue growing as a developer, contributing to meaningful projects, and helping businesses achieve their digital goals.
